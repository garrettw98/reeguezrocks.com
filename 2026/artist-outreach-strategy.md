- Intimate mountain setting with dedicated fanbase
- Four days of music (Thursday 5 PM - Monday 2 AM)

## Artist Tier Structure

### Tier-Based Booking Framework

Booking is tied to our crowdfunding tiers (not raw ticket counts), since we offer multiple ticket types and camping add-ons:

| Tier | Budget Unlocked | Artist Slots | Notes |
|------|-----------------|--------------|-------|
| Tier 2 | $6,000 | 1st Headliner + 2 Support | Phase 2 begins |
| Tier 6 | $6,000 | 2nd Headliner + 2 Support | Phase 3 begins |
| Tier 9 | $7,000 | 3rd Headliner + 2 Support | Phase 4 begins |
| Tier 10 | $4,000 | 3-4 Mid-tier Underground Acts | |
| Tier 12 | $12,000 | Marquee Headliner + 2 Support | Phase 5 begins |

### Artist Categories

**1. Headliners (Contract + Affiliate)**
- Fee: $4,000-$10,000 depending on tier
- Travel/accommodation covered
- Affiliate: $5 per ticket sold via their link (buyer gets 5% off)
- Letter of Intent required for conditional booking

**2. Support Acts (Contract + Affiliate)**
- Fee: $750-$1,500 per act
- Travel stipend available at higher tiers
- Affiliate: $5 per ticket sold via their link (buyer gets 5% off)

**3. Local/Opener DJs (No Upfront Fee)**
- Compensation: Share of 30% profit pool (based on set length)
- Affiliate: $5 per ticket sold via their link (buyer gets 5% off)
- Free festival pass + camping
- Points system: 1hr=2pts, 45min=1.5pts, 30min=1pt

---

## Conditional Booking Model

### How It Works

1. **Letter of Intent (LOI)** - Artist agrees to perform IF we unlock their funding tier
2. **Conditional Announcement** - We advertise: "[Artist] confirmed IF we unlock Tier [X]!"
3. **Tier Unlocked** - LOI converts to binding contract, deposit paid
4. **Tier Not Reached** - No obligation for either party

### Why Artists Should Consider This

- Zero risk to the artist (no commitment until tier is unlocked)
- Marketing exposure from being on conditional lineup
- Fan engagement (their followers can help unlock the tier via ticket/camping sales)
- Affiliate program incentivizes promotion ($5/ticket + 5% buyer discount)
- Transparent, community-driven event they can feel good about
- Unique mountain festival setting

### TEMPLATE A: Letter of Intent - Headliners ($4,000-$10,000)

**Subject:** Conditional Booking Opportunity - Reeguez Rocks 2026 (Underground Bass Festival)

---

Hi [Artist/Manager Name],

I'm Garrett, founder of Reeguez Rocks - a community-funded underground bass music festival entering its sixth year. We've grown from friends camping together to 80+ attendees, and for 2026 we've secured Camp Tahquitz in the San Bernardino Mountains with capacity for up to 2,000.

**Why I'm reaching out differently:**

We don't have corporate backing or investor money. Our entire event is funded by ticket sales, and we believe in radical transparency - every dollar is accounted for publicly on our website.

**The Offer:**

We'd like to add [Artist Name] to our lineup as a conditional headliner with this structure:

- **Funding Tier:** Tier [X] ($[X,XXX] budget unlocked)
- **Guaranteed Fee:** $[X,XXX] (paid when tier is reached)
- **Affiliate Program:** $5 per ticket sold via your promo link (buyer gets 5% off too)
- **Travel:** [Covered/Stipend amount]
- **Accommodation:** On-site cabin (sleeps 9) or campsite

**What This Means:**

- You're announced on our lineup NOW as "Confirmed if we unlock Tier [X]"
- Your fans see this and can help unlock your tier through any ticket or camping purchase
- If we don't reach the tier, no obligation for either party
- If we do, we execute a standard performance contract

**Why Consider This:**

- Zero risk commitment
- Marketing exposure to our community
- Earn $5 for every ticket sold through your link (and your fans save 5%)
- Support an artist-first, transparent festival model
- Beautiful 640-acre mountain venue at 6,500ft elevation
- Four days of underground bass music with a dedicated community

**Full Transparency:**

- Our complete budget breakdown: reeguezrocks.com/financials.html
- Discord community: discord.gg/kyfR6vXwgG

I'd love to discuss this further. Would you be open to a 15-minute call this week?

### TEMPLATE E: Profit Pool Pitch - Local DJs (No Guarantee)

**Subject:** Play Reeguez Rocks 2026 - Profit Share Opportunity

---

Hey [Name],

I'm building the local lineup for Reeguez Rocks 2026 and wanted to reach out.

**Honest pitch:** We can't offer guaranteed pay upfront. What we CAN offer:

**1. Profit Pool Share**
- 30% of our profit pool goes to local/opener DJs
- Split based on set length (1hr = 2 points, 45min = 1.5pts, 30min = 1pt)
- Example: If profit pool hits $3,000 and you have 2 points out of 20 total = $300

**2. Affiliate Commission**
- $5 for every ticket sold through your personal link
- Your buyers also get 5% off their purchase
- Sell 50 tickets = $250 guaranteed regardless of profit

**3. The Experience**
- 4-day festival pass (normally $99-179)
- Camping included
- Network with headliners and growing community
- Beautiful mountain venue with heated pool, lake, campfire bowl

**Full Transparency:**
Everything is public: reeguezrocks.com/financials.html

This isn't for everyone. If you need guaranteed pay, I totally understand. But if you believe in building something community-driven and want to be part of a growing festival, let's talk.
