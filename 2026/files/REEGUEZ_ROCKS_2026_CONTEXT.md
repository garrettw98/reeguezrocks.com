## Stage & Area Concept

### Main Stage (Subphonic Events)
- Primary stage for all headliners and main acts
- Scales with budget through 4 tier increases
- Budget progression: $3k → $6k → $9k → $12k
- Single large stage focus (no competing second stage at this scale)

### Campfire Bowl Amphitheater - Late Night Afters
- Natural amphitheater with excellent acoustics
- Keith's Soundboks system relocated here for afters
- Official late-night programming after main stage closes
- Intimate setting for underground/deeper sets

### The Dome - Chill Lounge
- Keith's geodesic dome structure
- Ambient/downtempo vibes only
- Chill space, not a competing stage
- ~30 person capacity
- Generator powered

### Future Consideration (2,000+ attendees)
- Second large production stage only makes sense at 2,000+ scale
- Current model focuses on one killer main stage vs two mediocre ones

## Compensation Model

### Philosophy
Everyone who contributes gets rewarded when the event succeeds. The profit pool grows with each tier reached (not just surplus), so there's always incentive to keep selling.

### Profit Pool - Tier Contributions
| Phase | Per Tier Reached | Tiers | Phase Total |
|-------|------------------|-------|-------------|
| Phase 1 | $300 | 3 | $900 |
| Phase 2 | $500 | 4 | $2,000 |
| Phase 3 | $750 | 4 | $3,000 |
| Phase 4 | $1,000 | 4 | $4,000 |
| **MAX** | | **15** | **$9,900** |

Plus any remaining surplus after tier expenses.

### Individual Affiliate Links
Everyone gets a trackable link to sell tickets:

| Role | Per Ticket Sold | Notes |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| Stage Partners | $3-4 | Highest rate - bringing production |
| Local/Opener DJs | $2 | Playing free, earn through promotion |
| Vendors | $2 | Reach their customer base |
| Contracted Artists | $1 | Optional - already getting paid |

### Who Gets Paid What
| Role | Upfront | Affiliate Link | Profit Pool |
|------|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Headliners | Contract | $1/tix (optional) | No |
| Support Acts | Contract | $1/tix (optional) | No |
| Local/Opener DJs | Free | **$2/ticket** | **YES** |
| Vendors | Booth fee | **$2/ticket** | No |
| Subphonic | $3k-12k | No | No |
| Keith (Dome) | $900 | No | No |
| Stage Partners | Base (Phase 3+) | **$3-4/ticket** | **YES** |
| Volunteers | Pass + meals | No | No |
| Organizers | $0 | No | **YES** |

### Profit Pool Distribution

**Phase 1-2 (No Partner Stages):**
| Recipient | % of Pool |
|-----------|-----------|
| Local/Opener Artist Pool | 30% |
| Organizers | 50% |
| Next Year Seed Fund | 20% |

**Phase 3-4 (With Partner Stages):**
| Recipient | % of Pool |
|-----------|-----------|
| Stage Partners (split) | 20% |
| Local/Opener Pool | 25% |
| Organizers | 40% |
| Next Year Seed Fund | 15% |

### Local DJ Pool Distribution
Based on set length:
- 1 hour = 2 points
- 45 min = 1.5 points
- 30 min = 1 point

**Formula:** (Your Points ÷ Total Points) × Local Pool = Pool Payout

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Single Main Stage Focus**: No second large stage at 1,500 attendees. One great stage > two mediocre stages. Second stage consideration begins at 2,000+.

2. **Subphonic Scales**: Instead of adding second stage, Subphonic's budget grows through 4 tiers ($3k → $6k → $9k → $12k).

3. **Afters at Amphitheater**: Keith's Soundboks system powers late-night afters at Campfire Bowl, not the Dome.

4. **Dome = Chill Space**: The geodesic dome is ambient/lounge only, not competing programming.

5. **Profit Pool Grows With Tiers**: Each tier adds to the pool (not just surplus), eliminating incentive to stop selling near tier thresholds.

6. **Everyone Has Affiliate Links**: DJs, vendors, partners all get trackable links with per-ticket kickbacks, creating a sales army.

7. **Partner Stages Delayed**: Stage partners only make sense at 500+ (Phase 3+). Subphonic and Keith are contracted first.
