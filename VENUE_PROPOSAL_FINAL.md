# Reeguez Rocks 2026: Venue Usage & Logistics Proposal
**To:** Camp Tahquitz Management / Tribe of Tahquitz
**From:** Wook Events / Reeguez Rocks Production Team
**Date:** January 26, 2026
**Subject:** Event Logistics, Access Requests, and Partnership Proposal

---

## 1. Executive Summary
For the 2026 edition of Reeguez Rocks, we are implementing a strategy with a strict attendance cap of **500 total persons** (450 attendees + 50 crew/artists). Our goal is to host a high-quality, intimate event that maximizes revenue for Camp Tahquitz while minimizing impact on the land.

**Wook Events** will oversee the entire event, with **Subphonic Events** serving as the professional production company handling stage production, sound, and lighting.

This proposal outlines our specific requests for facility usage, camping configurations, and financial partnership models.

### Event Dates & Schedule
*   **Main Event:** Thursday, October 15 through Monday, October 19, 2026. Programming will continue until sunrise on Monday morning, after which all activities will shut down.
*   **Early Access:** Wednesday, October 14, 2026 will be available as an optional $20 add-on for attendees who wish to secure the best camping spots. No programming will occur on this day. While the venue may not be fully set up, all essential amenities and areas that attendees may need will be available.
*   **Attendee Departure:** All attendees must clear the property by noon on Monday, October 19, 2026.
*   **Load-In:** Tuesday, October 13, 2026, with the possibility of beginning one day earlier if deemed necessary.
*   **Load-Out:** Monday, October 19 (afternoon) through Tuesday, October 20, 2026, with the possibility of extending if required to ensure the venue is left in pristine condition following Leave No Trace principles.

## 2. Venue Usage & Key Areas

### The Bowl (Main Stage)
*   **Usage:** Primary performance area.
*   **Power:** Industrial-level generators placed in designated fire-safe locations.
*   **Heating/Ambiance:** We request permission to utilize the Camp’s propane campfire units within The Bowl to provide warmth.
    *   *Safety Protocol:* All units will be surrounded by crowd-control barricades to ensure safe distances for attendees dancing or standing nearby.
*   **Sanitation:** We recognize The Bowl lacks immediate restroom access. We will rent and place **2–4 porta-potties** just outside The Bowl entrance to reduce foot traffic to the Commissary.

### The Dome (Afters Stage)
*   **Structure:** An enclosed 28-foot PVC geodesic dome serving as a smaller, intimate performance space.
*   **Purpose:** Due to its smaller nature, The Dome will function as a quieter "afters" location, allowing us to continue the event experience until after sunrise each day while respecting camp quiet hours.
*   **Sound Management:** This setup allows us to shut down the main stage production at The Bowl by **1:30-2:00 AM**, significantly reducing overall camp noise levels during late-night hours.
*   **Proposed Location:** **Campsite 7**, or alternatively between **Campsites 4 and 6**, depending on final site layout.
*   **Future Expansion:** We are exploring the creation of **2 additional spaces** similar in style to The Dome, though these plans are still being finalized.

### Power Infrastructure
*   **The Dome:** Will be operated completely on solar and battery power, minimizing environmental impact and noise pollution.
*   **The Bowl:** Will utilize industrial-level generators positioned in designated fire-safe locations away from attendee areas.
*   **Request:** Please provide details on existing power availability at key areas of camp, including:
    *   Commissary area (for vendor electrical needs)
    *   Potential secondary stage locations such as Campsite 7 or the area between Campsites 4 and 6
    *   Any other areas with accessible power outlets or hookups
    *   *This information will help us determine whether additional generators or battery systems are needed for vendor operations and smaller stage setups.*

### Program Areas (Revenue Opportunities for Camp)
We are eager to open specific program areas as paid add-ons, with **100% of proceeds going directly to Camp Tahquitz** (event takes 0% cut).
1.  **Climbing Wall & High Cope:** If staffing allows, attendees would pay individually for access.
2.  **Arts & Crafts (Kandi Making):** A fundraiser in the spirit of the Craft Lodge (making "Rave Kandi" bracelets).
    *   *Location:* Ideally the Craft Lodge, or a separate designated area if the Lodge is unavailable.
    *   *Beneficiary:* Proceeds donated to The Tribe of Tahquitz or Camp General Fund.

## 3. Lodging & Structures

We request to book the following structures to accommodate our artists, staff, and attendees.

### K-Lodge (Event HQ)
*   **Usage:** Production Headquarters, Will Call, Green Room, and Multi-purpose space.
*   **Apartment:** We request to use the K-Lodge apartment for high-tier artist accommodation.
*   **Kitchen:** Usage for crew/artist catering.
    *   *Operations:* The kitchen will be operated by **designated, experienced crew members** to ensure strict fire safety and cleanliness protocols are followed.
*   **Request:** Please confirm the specific bed/room count in the apartment.

### Health Lodge
*   **Usage:** High-tier artist accommodation.
*   **Medical:** The lobby/clinic area will remain accessible for our medical staff (see "Medical & Safety" below).
*   **Request:** Please confirm the specific bed/room count in the apartment.

### Family Cabins
*   **Usage:** Attendee lodging.
*   **Proposal:** We request to reserve these block-style for the event.
*   **Rate Offer:** **$250 per cabin** (paid by Reeguez Rocks to Camp).
*   **Request:** Please confirm the total number of Family Cabins available to rent.

### Director Cabins
*   **Usage:** Lodging for the Subphonic Events production crew or high-tier artist accommodations.
*   **Request:** Please provide information on the Director Cabins regarding: (1) whether they have full bathrooms, (2) whether they have kitchens, and (3) how many people each cabin can reasonably accommodate.

## 4. Camping Strategy

We have designed a structured camping layout to maximize capacity safely while maintaining clear emergency access throughout the venue.

### Car Camping (Assigned 10'x30' Spots)
Car camping areas will be organized in a "Roman camp" style layout, emphasizing order, efficiency, and safety.
*   **Locations:** Campsites 2, 3, 4, 6, 13, 15, and 16.
*   **Potential Additional Locations:** If needed, we may request use of **The Wrangler** (with corrals dismantled pre-event and rebuilt post-event) and/or the **Shooting Sports areas** (Rifle, Shotgun, and Archery ranges) for additional car camping capacity.
*   **Space Allocation:** Each camping party will be assigned a designated 10'x30' space for their vehicle and camping equipment.
*   **Layout:** Vehicles and tents will be organized into straight, aligned lanes to maximize space utilization and maintain visual order throughout the camping areas.
*   **Fire & Travel Lanes:** A **20-foot-wide lane** will be maintained between each row of camping spaces. These lanes serve dual purposes: providing emergency vehicle access and creating clear pedestrian travel corridors throughout the camping zones.

### RV Camping (Dry Camping)
*   **Location:** K-Lodge Parking Lot.
*   **Type:** Dry camping only (no hookups).

### GA Primitive Camping (Walk-In)
Primitive camping will be held in areas not accessible by vehicle, offering a more dispersed and natural camping experience.
*   **Locations:** Campsites 7, 8, 9, 10, and 17.
*   **Potential Additional Locations:** If needed, we may request use of **The Wrangler** and/or the **Shooting Sports areas** (Rifle, Shotgun, and Archery ranges) for additional primitive camping capacity.
*   **Drop-Off Procedure:** Campers will drive to the designated entrance points of these campsites to unload their gear. Once unloaded, vehicles must immediately be moved to the designated parking locations (Main Lot + Staff Lot overflow).
*   **No Vehicle Storage:** Cars will not be permitted to remain at primitive camping locations under any circumstances.
*   **Staff Direction:** Dedicated staff members will be stationed at drop-off points to direct vehicles to appropriate parking areas and ensure smooth traffic flow during arrival periods.
*   **Space Utilization:** Unlike the structured car camping areas, primitive sites will be less densely packed, allowing campers to spread out and utilize the available natural space as much as possible.

### Pre-Set Camping ("Glamping")
*   **Location:** Ideally in an area where attendees can either park directly at their campsites or have easy and quick access to their vehicles. **Campsite 4** (specifically the area closest to the trail leading to The Bowl) is our preferred location.
*   **Equipment Sourcing:** We are exploring options to either rent pre-set camping equipment from an outfitter or purchase the gear outright.
*   **Potential Partnership Opportunity:** Should we choose to purchase the camping equipment outright rather than renting, Camp Tahquitz may have the option to purchase the gear from us at the conclusion of the event. This could provide an easy and cost-effective way for the camp to acquire quality camping setups for scout troops in need during the summer camp season. If this is something of interest, we would love to discuss possibilities.

## 5. Operations & Logistics

### Land Stewardship & Fire Safety
We are committed to protecting Camp Tahquitz's infrastructure and natural environment throughout the event.
*   **Meadow Protection:** All meadow areas on camp property are designated as strict no-access zones. Our security and crew will be trained to enforce a "No Camping / No Entering" policy to protect these sensitive ecosystems.
*   **Volunteer Clean-Up Crew:** We will have a team of volunteers throughout the event who trade their labor for a free ticket. These volunteers will focus on maintaining a clean environment by picking up trash and monitoring waste receptacles across the venue.
*   **Leave No Trace:** Following the conclusion of the event, we will conduct a comprehensive Leave No Trace sweep across the entirety of camp to ensure the property is returned to its original condition.
*   **Request:** Please provide information regarding the camp's waste management system, including whether we need to bring in dumpsters and smaller collection receptacles, or if existing infrastructure is available for our use.
*   **No Campfires:** Campfires will be strictly prohibited anywhere on the property. This policy will be clearly communicated to all attendees prior to and during the event.
*   **Cooking Stoves:** Portable cooking stoves are permitted but must strictly use containerized fuel only (propane canisters, butane cartridges, etc.). No liquid fuel stoves will be allowed.
*   **Designated Smoking Areas:** Smoking sections will be clearly labeled and located in fire-safe areas away from vegetation and structures.
*   **Fire Safety Patrol:** Dedicated team members will be assigned to rotating shifts throughout the event, continuously roaming the venue to identify and address any fire-related hazards.
*   **Generator Placement:** All generators will be positioned in pre-approved, fire-safe locations with appropriate clearance from vegetation and structures.
*   **Fire Extinguishers:** Fire extinguishers will be stationed at all stage areas, vendor locations, and throughout camping zones.

### Security & Access Control
*   **Gate Staff:** Security will consist of a volunteer crew positioned at the entrance to camp. These individuals will be responsible for managing inflow and outflow of attendees, including ticketing and credential verification.
*   **ID Check & Wristbanding:** All attendees will undergo strict ID checks at the gate to verify age (21+) before receiving their wristband.
*   **Traffic Management:** We will implement a rapid check-in process to ensure vehicles move efficiently off Highway 38 and do not cause traffic backups.
*   **Security Lead:** A designated **Security Lead** will be on duty at all times to manage the volunteer team and handle any de-escalation needs.
*   **Trusted Volunteers:** Gate staff will be trusted individuals who trade their labor for free admission to the event, ensuring reliable and dedicated coverage throughout the event duration.
*   **Gate Hours:** Wednesday (Early Access): 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM. Thursday through Sunday: 12:00 PM – 10:00 PM.

### Attendee Policies
*   **No Animals:** No pets or animals of any kind will be allowed on the property during the event.
*   **Re-Entry:** Re-entry to the event will be available during gate hours only. No re-entry will be permitted outside of these hours.
*   **Vehicle Movement:** Once vehicles are parked in car camping areas, they will not be allowed to exit and re-enter. Any vehicle that leaves car camping and returns during the event will be placed in GA parking regardless of ticket type. Car camping spots will not be held or regained once vacated.
*   **Drones:** Personal drones are strictly prohibited. Only authorized production crew will be permitted to operate drones for official event documentation purposes.

### Accessibility
*   **ADA Accommodations:** We are committed to making Reeguez Rocks accessible to attendees with disabilities. Designated accessible camping areas will be reserved near key facilities.
*   **Dedicated ADA Host:** A dedicated host will be available to assist attendees with ADA needs in accessing The Bowl and other available camping areas. This service is available with advanced notice.
*   **Accommodation Requests:** Attendees requiring special accommodations are encouraged to contact us in advance so we can ensure their needs are met.

### Amenities & Safety
*   **Water Stations:** Free potable water refill stations will be set up at multiple locations throughout the venue, including near stage areas, the Commissary, and central camping zones. Attendees will be encouraged to bring reusable water bottles.
*   **Pathway Lighting:** Solar-powered and battery-operated pathway lighting will be installed along main walkways and high-traffic areas to ensure safe navigation during nighttime hours.
*   **Cell Service Notice:** Cell phone service at Camp Tahquitz may be limited or unavailable. Attendees will be informed of this in advance and encouraged to establish meeting points with their groups. Event staff will maintain radio communication for emergencies.

### Weather Contingency
*   **Monitoring:** Event leadership will actively monitor weather forecasts in the days and weeks leading up to the event. Real-time weather monitoring will continue throughout the event.
*   **Severe Weather Protocol:** In the event of severe weather (thunderstorms, high winds, or early snow), programming may be temporarily paused and attendees directed to shelter in vehicles or designated structures. If conditions pose a safety risk, evacuation procedures will be initiated per our emergency plan.
*   **Attendee Preparedness:** Attendees will be advised in advance to prepare for variable mountain weather conditions, including cold overnight temperatures and the possibility of rain. Proper gear and warm clothing will be strongly recommended.

### Photography & Media
*   **Official Documentation:** Authorized photographers and videographers will be present to capture the event for promotional and archival purposes.
*   **Media Credentials:** Media passes will be available for approved press and content creators. All media inquiries should be directed to the production team in advance of the event.
*   **Attendee Consent:** By attending the event, attendees consent to being photographed or recorded, with images potentially used for event promotion. This will be clearly stated in ticket purchase terms.

### Age & Alcohol Policy
*   **Age Requirement:** This will be a **21+ event**. Due to the nature of the event, most insurance policies require a 21+ age limit. If deemed possible in the future, we would like to explore lowering this to 18+.
*   **Alcohol Policy:** Alcohol will be **BYOB (Bring Your Own Beverage)**. Should we receive permission from BSA to sell alcohol on site, we would bring in a proper vendor, obtain all necessary permitting and licensing, and follow all applicable laws and regulations.

### Sound Management
*   **Compliance:** We intend to follow all San Bernardino County laws and regulations regarding noise levels for the venue. These regulations will be strictly enforced to maintain full compliance throughout the event.

### Emergency Preparedness
*   **Crew Training:** On Wednesday morning before attendees arrive, all crew members will gather for a comprehensive fire drill and emergency protocol briefing. Every crew member will understand the exact procedures for any and all evacuation and emergency scenarios.
*   **Documentation:** Official maps and emergency plans will be created and distributed to every crew member to ensure they know with complete certainty what to do and where to instruct attendees to go in any emergency situation.

### Parking & Vehicle Capacity
*   **Estimated Vehicles:** Based on attendance size and camping options, we predict no more than **350 vehicles** will enter the property. Carpooling will be encouraged and will naturally occur among our community.

### Insurance & Liability
*   **Coverage:** Wook Events will maintain all required insurance and liability coverage as specified by Camp Tahquitz and any applicable regulations. We are prepared to provide a **$1M/$2M General Liability Policy** listing the Council as **Additional Insured**. Proof of insurance will be provided upon request.

### Medical & Safety
*   **Staffing Proposal:** We propose hiring **Brennon Polenske** via a licensed local EMT staffing service.
*   **Reasoning:** As a former Health Lodge volunteer and staff member, Brennon has intimate knowledge of the camp's infrastructure and emergency protocols.

### Heating Infrastructure
*   **Request:** Utilization of the Camp's existing portable propane heating elements (patio heaters/blowers) to create "Warming Zones" throughout the venue, as well as the dual large campfires in The Bowl for ambiance and warmth.
*   **Request:** Please provide details on the costs associated with utilizing the various heating elements offered by the camp, including small portable propane campfires, propane blowers/patio heaters, and the dual large campfires in The Bowl.

### Vendors
*   **Location:** Dining area outside the Commissary and the adjacent staff parking lot.
*   **Compliance:** All vendors will be fully licensed and insured.

### Water & Sanitation Audit
*   **Request:** To ensure code compliance for 500 people, we need a current count of:
    *   Functioning Flush Toilets
    *   Showers
    *   Potable Water Spigots
*   **Action:** Based on these numbers, we will rent additional infrastructure if the existing facilities do not meet the per-head requirement.

## 6. Financial Proposal: The "Per-Day" Venue Fee

In alignment with our crowdfunding model, we propose a venue fee structure based on **daily attendance** to ensure Camp Tahquitz sees significant revenue from ticket sales.

*   **Fee Structure:** **$10 per ticket, per event day**
*   **Example:** A 4-Day General Admission Ticket sold at $119 -> **$40** (approx. 33%) goes directly to Camp Tahquitz
*   **Goal:** With 450 paid attendees, this structure aims to generate substantially more revenue for the camp than a flat rental fee, while keeping ticket prices accessible for our community.

### Ticket Sales Timeline
*   **Early Sales:** We would like to begin selling tickets as early as **February 2026**, potentially before all event details are finalized, to build momentum and gauge community interest.
*   **Refund Policy:** In the event that the venue rental does not proceed, full refunds will be offered to all ticket purchasers.

### Payment Terms
*   **Deposit:** Upon finalizing the event rental agreement, we will determine an appropriate deposit amount and payment timeline.
*   **Final Payment:** All final payments will be issued **NET 30 days** from the conclusion of the event. This allows time for all transactions to process and any unexpected costs to be settled and accounted for.

### Facility Rentals
*   **Cabin Rentals:** We will rent cabins on a block basis, only paying for the facilities actually used during the event.
*   **Payment:** Payment for all facility rentals (cabins, lodges, etc.) will be included with the final payment, issued NET 30 days from the conclusion of the event.
