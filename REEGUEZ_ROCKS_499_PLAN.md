# Reeguez Rocks 2026: 499 Capacity Master Plan

**Status:** Defined Strategy
**Permit Threshold:** < 500 Total Bodies on Site

---

## 1. Capacity Breakdown
*   **Total Capacity:** 499 Persons
*   **Paid Tickets:** 450
*   **Staff / Artists / Guest List:** 49
    *   *Constraint:* Staffing must be lean. Artists likely need to be "play and stay" or local to minimize guest list usage.

## 2. Financials (Rough Estimates)
*   **Ticket Pricing:** Maintained from original plan ($99 - $179).
*   **Estimated Revenue:**
    *   Tickets (450 avg @ $120): ~$54,000
    *   Car Camping (150 @ $40): ~$6,000
    *   **Total Budget:** **~$60,000** (Down from $95k stretch)
*   **Cost Scaling:**
    *   Production: Scaled for "The Bowl" only (cheaper than Meadow).
    *   Medical: Reduced requirement (likely 2 EMTs vs 6).
    *   Talent: Budget reduces to ~$20k-$25k.

## 3. Venue & Infrastructure
### Stages
1.  **The Bowl (Main Stage):** 
    *   Amphitheater setting. 
    *   Runs 12:00 PM - 12:00 AM.
    *   Focus on high-fidelity sound and immersive lighting rather than massive video walls.
2.  **The Dome (Late Night):** 
    *   28ft Geodesic Dome.
    *   Runs 12:00 AM - Sunrise.
    *   Chill/Downtempo vibes.
3.  **Sound Camps:**
    *   Highly encouraged to fill the gaps in the forest.
    *   Strict "No Generator" rule applies.

### Camping & Parking
*   **Car Camping:** 
    *   **Capacity:** ~150 spots.
    *   **Revenue Gen:** Critical upsell ($40-$50).
    *   *Logistics:* First come, first served on location, or designated zones.
*   **GA Camping:**
    *   **Capacity:** ~300 spots.
    *   **Logistics:** Park in main lot, walk gear to forest camping areas.

## 4. Lineup Strategy
*   **Vibe:** Boutique Bass. "Relevant size" headliners.
*   **Booking:** 
    *   Target acts that fit the ~500 cap vibe (Cult followings, rising stars, high energy).
    *   Avoid "Stadium" Dubstep acts that cost $15k+ alone.
    *   *Names to consider:* TBD (based on new budget).

## 5. Crowdfunding Model (Revised)
**Goal:** Generate hype with frequent unlocks, despite lower total count.
**Structure:** 10 Tiers (45 tickets per tier).

| Tier | Price | Milestones / Unlocks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1** | $99 | **Event Confirmed** (Foundation costs covered) |
| **Tier 2** | $109 | **Headliner 1 Announced** |
| **Tier 3** | $119 | Production Upgrade (Lasers?) |
| **Tier 4** | $129 | **Headliner 2 Announced** |
| **Tier 5** | $139 | The Dome Upgrade (Comfy furniture/decor) |
| **Tier 6** | $149 | **Headliner 3 Announced** |
| **Tier 7** | $159 | Art Installation Unlock |
| **Tier 8** | $169 | Interactive Game/Activity Unlock |
| **Tier 9** | $179 | **Full Lineup Drop** |
| **Tier 10** | $189 | Final Stretch (Community Fund Bonus) |
