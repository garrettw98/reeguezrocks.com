# Reeguez Rocks 2026: 499 Capacity Master Plan

**Status:** Defined Strategy
**Permit Strategy:** Soft Cap 499 / Hard Cap 550

---

## 1. Capacity Breakdown
*   **Target Capacity (Soft Cap):** 499 Persons (Permit Target)
*   **Maximum Tolerance (Hard Cap):** 550 Persons (Absolute Limit)
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Paid Tickets:** ~450 - 500
    *   **Staff / Artists / Guest List:** ~50
    *   *Policy:* Strict Guest List. The buffer between 499 and 550 is primarily for essential staff and artists to ensure we don't oversell public tickets.

## 2. Financial Model (Scaling)
*   **Total Budget Goal:** ~$92,000 (Full 10-Tier sellout + Add-ons)
*   **Break-Even Point:** ~$5,950 (Tier 1 / 50 Tickets)
*   **Revenue streams:**
    *   Tickets (499 cap, avg price ~$160): ~$80,000
    *   Car Camping (200 @ $40): ~$8,000
    *   Glamping/Cabins/RV: ~$15,000
*   **Key Expense Scaling:**
    *   **Venue:** **$10 per guest per day** (Approx $40 total for 4-day guests)
    *   **Cabin Rental:** **$250 per cabin** (6 total)
    *   **Production:** **$30 (Bowl) + $7 (Dome) per ticket sold** (Target ~$18,500 total)
    *   **Talent:** ~$25,000 - $35,000
    *   **Ops/Safety:** ~$10,000 - $15,000

## 3. Venue & Infrastructure
### Stages
1.  **The Bowl (Main Stage):** 
    *   Amphitheater setting. 
    *   Runs 12:00 PM - 12:00 AM.
    *   Focus: High-fidelity audio (Bass priority).
2.  **The Dome (Late Night):** 
    *   28ft Geodesic Dome.
    *   Runs 12:00 AM - Sunrise.
    *   **Audio:** Low-volume amplified.
    *   **Programming:** Scheduled DJs + Open Deck slots.
3.  **Sound Camps:**
    *   **Policy:** **Strict BYO Power (Solar/Battery Only).**
    *   *Support:* The festival will NOT provide generators or shore power for sound camps. This is a "Leave No Trace" / Eco-conscious constraint.

### Camping & Parking
*   **Car Camping:** 
    *   **Capacity:** ~150 cars.
    *   **Location:** Upper and Lower Meadows.
    *   **Logistics:** **Assigned Spots.** Staff will guide cars to specific high-density parking locations to maximize space.
    *   **Revenue:** Critical upsell.
*   **GA Camping:**
    *   **Capacity:** Unlimited (within ticket cap).
    *   **Vibe:** Primitive, roomy, forest setting. More space per person than Car Camping.

## 4. Food & Beverage Policy
*   **Alcohol:**
    *   **Sales:** YES. Pursuing LBAC BSA license to sell alcohol on-site.
    *   **Policy:** BYOB is permitted for campsites (glass ban enforced).
*   **Food:**
    *   **Vendors:** 1-2 select food vendors.
    *   **Policy:** BYO Food highly encouraged due to limited vendor options.

## 5. Operations & Logistics
*   **Gate/Entry:**
    *   **Primary:** Digital Scanning (QR Codes via reliable internet/Starlink).
    *   **Backup:** Name/ID Lookup (Digital manifest).
    *   **Documentation:** Attendees advised to bring digital download or physical print.
*   **Medical/Safety:**
    *   **Facility:** On-site "Health Lodge" (Existing infrastructure).
    *   **Staffing:** Start with Volunteer EMTs; scale to Hired Event Medical Company as budget allows.
*   **Artist Lodging:**
    *   **Headliners:** **"K Lodge"**. Serves as Green Room, HQ, and sleeping quarters.
    *   **Support Artists:** GA or Car Camping. (Community integration).
*   **Visual Theme:**
    *   **Direction:** **"Forest/Nature/Mystical"** (Pivoting away from Sci-Fi/Space).
    *   *Goal:* Enhance the "Back to Roots" organic feel.

## 6. Lineup Strategy
*   **Vibe:** Boutique Bass. "Relevant size" headliners.
*   **Booking:** 
    *   Target acts that fit the ~500 cap vibe.
    *   4-Day Event structure justifies higher tier pricing.

## 7. Marketing Strategy
*   **Theme:** **"Back to Roots" / Underground Community.**
*   **Hook:** This isn't a massive commercial festival; it's a return to the core community vibe. Intimate, raw, high-quality music in the woods.
*   **Exclusivity:** "Join the 499."
*   **Tier Display:**
    *   **Strategy:** Display **ALL** 10 tiers.
    *   **Visual:** Mark past tiers as "SOLD OUT" to drive FOMO.

## 8. Crowdfunding Model
**Structure:** 10 Tiers (Automatic progression based on sales volume/cost coverage).

| Tier | Price | Milestones / Unlocks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1** | $119 | **Foundation Set** (Insurance, permits, and core ops secured) |
| **Tier 2** | $129 | **Event Confirmed** (100% committed to October) |
| **Tier 3** | $139 | **Headliner 1 Unlock** (First major artist secured) |
| **Tier 4** | $149 | **Immersive Forest** (Visual decor and custom lighting) |
| **Tier 5** | $159 | **Headliner 2 Unlock** (Second major artist secured) |
| **Tier 6** | $169 | **Local Art Grants** (Funding interactive installations) |
| **Tier 7** | $179 | **Headliner 3 Unlock** (Third major artist secured) |
| **Tier 8** | $189 | **Daytime Magic** (Yoga, workshops, forest vibes) |
| **Tier 9** | $199 | **Final Reveal** (Full support lineup & set times) |
| **Tier 10** | $209 | **The Full Send** (Lasers) |

**Announcement Logic:**
*   **Standard:** Artist name revealed *after* tier sells out (Reward).
*   **Hype (LOI):** If LOI secured, name revealed *during* tier ("Buy to unlock X!").
